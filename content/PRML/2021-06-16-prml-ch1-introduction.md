数学符号的约定

Vectors are denoted by lower case bold Roman letters such as
x, and all vectors are assumed to be column vectors. A superscript T denotes the
transpose of a matrix or vector, so that `$x^T$` will be a row vector. Uppercase bold
roman letters, such as M, denote matrices. The notation `$(w_1, . . . , w_M)$` denotes a
row vector with M elements, while the corresponding column vector is written as `$w = (w_1, . . . , w_M)^T$`
